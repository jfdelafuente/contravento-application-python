## 🎯 Current Status (2025-12-30)

**Completed**: Phase 1-2 (Setup + Foundation) + Major portions of Phase 3-5

**Latest Achievement**: ✅ **Statistics Integration** (commit `92e3173`)

**Critical Implementation Highlights**:

- ✅ User Story 1 (MVP): Create, publish trips with **auto stats update** (T034-T045)
- ✅ User Story 2 (Photos): Upload, delete, reorder photos with **stats tracking** (T046-T063)
- ✅ User Story 3 (Edit/Delete): Service layer complete with **stats sync** (T073-T075)
  - ⏳ API endpoints pending (T076-T077)
- ✅ **Stats Integration Feature**:
  - Auto-update on publish/edit/delete trips
  - Photo count tracking (add/remove)
  - Achievement verification & awarding
  - See: `STATS_INTEGRATION.md` for full documentation

**Next Steps**: Complete API endpoints for edit/delete (T076-T077), integration tests, tag filtering

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application structure:
- Backend: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- Storage: `backend/storage/`
- Config: `backend/.env`, `backend/src/config.py`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ✅

- [x] T017 Add trips relationship to User model in backend/src/models/user.py
- [x] T018 Create Pydantic schemas in backend/src/schemas/trip.py (TripCreateRequest, TripUpdateRequest, TripResponse, PhotoResponse, etc.)
- [x] T019 Write unit tests for trip schemas in backend/tests/unit/test_trip_schemas.py
- [x] T020 Generate Alembic migration with `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add_travel_diary_tables"`
- [x] T021 Review and edit migration file in backend/src/migrations/versions/ (verify PostgreSQL/SQLite compatibility)
- [x] T022 Apply migration with `alembic upgrade head`
- [x] T023 Verify migration created all 5 tables (trips, trip_photos, tags, trip_tags, trip_locations)
- [x] T024 Write unit tests for Trip model in backend/tests/unit/test_trip_model.py (creation, validation, relationships)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies (photos independent feature)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies (edit/delete independent)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies (tags already processed in US1)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Updates US1 code but testable independently

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD Red)
- Implementation makes tests PASS (TDD Green)
- Manual testing validates user experience
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tests (T011-T014) can run in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all contract tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T026: "Contract test for POST /trips"
Task T027: "Contract test for POST /trips/{id}/publish"
Task T028: "Contract test for GET /trips/{id}"

# Launch all integration tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T029: "Integration test for trip creation workflow"
Task T030: "Integration test for trip publication workflow"

# Launch all unit tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T031: "Unit test for TripService.create_trip()"
Task T032: "Unit test for TripService.publish_trip()"

# Then implement services sequentially (they modify same file):
Task T034: "Implement TripService.create_trip()"
Task T035: "Implement TripService.get_trip()"
Task T036: "Implement TripService.publish_trip()"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create and Publish trips)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Result**: Working trip creation and publication system

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Photos) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Edit/Delete) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Tags) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Drafts) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T026-T045)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T046-T063)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T064-T079)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Reduce time to market significantly

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 117

**Tasks by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 6 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 19 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1): 20 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2): 18 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3): 16 tasks
- Phase 6 (User Story 4): 12 tasks
- Phase 7 (User Story 5): 12 tasks
- Phase 8 (Polish): 14 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 47 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
- 5 user stories can run in parallel after Foundational phase

**MVP Scope** (Recommended first delivery):
- Phase 1 (Setup): T001-T006 (6 tasks)
- Phase 2 (Foundational): T007-T025 (19 tasks)
- Phase 3 (User Story 1): T026-T045 (20 tasks)
- **Total for MVP**: 45 tasks

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Create trip → Publish → Appears in profile
- US2: Upload photos → Gallery displays correctly
- US3: Edit trip → Delete trip → Stats updated
- US4: Add tags → Filter by tag → Discover trips
- US5: Save draft → Publish later → Transitions correctly

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD strictly enforced: Write test → Test fails (Red) → Implement → Test passes (Green)
- Commit after each logical group or checkpoint
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All API responses follow `{success, data, error}` structure
- All user-facing messages in Spanish
- HTML sanitization applied to all description content
- Photo processing uses background tasks
- Tag matching is case-insensitive via normalized column
- Optimistic locking prevents concurrent edit conflicts

**Generated**: 2025-12-24
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Implementation
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 (Setup) or run `/speckit.implement` to start guided implementation
